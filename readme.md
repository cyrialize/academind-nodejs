# What is this?

This code is the result of me going through the course [NodeJS - The Complete Guide by Academind on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-the-complete-guide/).

# Differences between code and course

I've been using this course to learn Node and it's definitely going to be code I look over later when beginning other Node projects. 

I have added additional comments for my own learning and so that it is easier to figure out the choices made when I look back on the code.
